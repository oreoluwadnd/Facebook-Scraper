I also think it will be a great place to share ideas of activities, what to do and where to go, and to make new friends in around Lagos. Friendly weirdos will be tolerated , unfriendliness, hate, bullying or the forcing of one's opinions on others will not. This group was created with love and is only for nice people.

          "description": "Abuja CityPublic · 12K members · 10+ posts a dayBusiness,Events, Networking, Travel , Entertainment, Lifestyle, Careers, Politicss and Current Affairs Abuja, officially Abuja Municipal Area Council or AMAC, is the capital city of Nigeria. It is located in the centre of Nigeria in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Abuja is a \"planned\" city, as it was mainly built in the 1980s and officially became Nigeria's capital on 12 December 1991, replacing the role of the previous capital Lagos. As of the 2006 census, the Federal Capital Territory has a population of 778,567. Abuja's geography is defined by Aso Rock, a 400-metre monolith left by water erosion. The Presidential Complex, National Assembly, Supreme Court and much of the town extend to the south of the rock. \"Aso\" means \"victorious\" in the language of the (now displaced) Asokoro (\"the people of victory\"). Other sights include the Nigerian National Mosque and the Nigerian National Christian Centre. The city is served by the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, while Zuma Rock lies nearby. Abuja is known for being the best purpose-built city in Africa. Why invest in the development of Abuja City? Abuja is the fastest growing city in Nigeria where you find all ethnic groups and foreigners living and working together. It is quickly becoming one of the top investment choices for both private and business investors from all over the world. In fact, it has become a very successful and strategic regional hub. Compared to any major international city, London, New York, Paris or Dubai property is still relatively cheap but rising steadily. Population migration, new property finance packages, changes in property ownership laws and the growth in tourism has led to huge investment in the property market. The rapid expansion of Abuja as an international hub is bringing in more and more expatriates. Against this background of rising property prices, rental yields have increased sharply in recent years. This is largely as a result of a serious shortage of accommodation. Whilst there is ongoing major development, it is believed that more people will continue to flow into the region, gaining employment in the many new institutional, commercial and business centre’s due to open over the next couple of years. This will provide a ready supply of tenants for the many residential complexes currently in construction and maintain strong rental yields. Ultimately, all master planning will continue with adequate government controls so the demand to supply ratio is manageable. Banks and financial institutions in Nigeria are expanding their mortgage options on a daily basis, the net effect is to lower the cost of borrowing. Ultimately, Abuja City is set to prosper from the massive amount of investment, which in turn should invigorate the centre and eventually spread out way beyond our comprehension today. What is needed now are Investors and Stakeholders. Not just Investors for capital gains but investors in the future of Nigeria. Abuja belongs to all, but you have to be ready for the challenges. One of the greatest resources available to Nigeria is its people, we have visionaries, high achievers, reputable and progressive people both in Nigeria and on a global scale. The vision is simple and any stakeholder, overseas or resident, can buy into the concept. In 2010 we celebrate the 11th year in existence of www.AbujaCity.com a vision, a website and a reflection of a city in progress. Today we invite you on a journey to share in our vision. Stay tuned...

IF YOUR NAME IS ON THIS LIST PLEASE, CONTACT THE ADMIN TO CLARIFY YOURSELF AND TO TELL US YOUR OWN SIDE OF THE STORY. Thanks for been a member of this group. How to find genuine product/ good or service sellers on internet (online) 1.Selling Price. If the selling price is below average think deeply about it? 2.Contact the sellers through phone call Step1. call the sellers through a phone, tell them you are in state A and ask which state they are. And their office address. Step 2. After an hour or a day use another phone number to call them; at this point, tell them that you are in the exact address that was giving to you. And ask for their office address if they are genuine their address will not change from the first time you call them. 3.Pay after delivery: this is the best way to confirm if the seller is genuine or not. But in this case the buyer is expected to pay for the cost of transporting the goods either he or she buys the good or not. 4.Do Google search (Facbook search, Nairaland) on the sellers: just enter keywords (name, phone number, product name )about the person on Google and see what other have said about them Thank you. www.registercompany.com.ngJoin"

          "description": "IBADAN RENT without AGENTPublic · 30K members · 10 posts a dayIn the recent times, house rent in the city of IBADAN is not affordable, difficult and challenging and thereby depriving people to secure their dream accomodations due to some scrupulous elements parading themselves as House Agents. The extortions start from Inspection fees, Service charge, Agent fees, Maintenance fees and caution fees. This group is created to tackle it and make Rent easy, affordable and accessible for all. How could this be done? Simply by recommendations or referrals of prospective tenants to a Landlord and agreement would be made between the landlord's lawyer(s) and the tenants Let's try to make this work and to save money, time and energy wasting on Agents. We can promote this group for all seeking accomodations in Ibadan. It would also enable anyone relocating to sell their properties. Thanks God bless you all.Join"

I was born in a township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha , Site B which is where I spent most of my life with my family. Just like any other kid from the township music is something you hear everywhere Shebeen , Homes, Cars so I was fascinated by sounds and instruments but time went by , year 2014 is the year I will never forget because that is the year I learnt how to Dj then I learnt how to make beats on Softwares like FruitLoops . At first I made Hip Hop Beats then in 2015 I started having an interest in Gqom music which has open doors for me because I got radio plays on Local Radio Station, Local supermarkets like Shoprite played a huge part in playing my music, other Djs playing my music in their own sets , CTV also used my music for their shows. I released my debut album called \"International Gqom\" this year online and it was downloaded +13k times . I am also working with up and coming local producers and artist around Cape Town .

As you all know, ABA has been known for its industrial capacity and has proven over decades that it has the human resource ability to compete with the rest of the developing world if given the much needed support. On this capacity it was dubbed the (Japan or China) of Africa. With little or no help from the government the intellectual and creative minds in the city of ABA have been able to turn this great city into industrial hub of Africa. Exporting the great talents and creativities of this city beyond the shores of Nigeria, even Africa. Though yet to get its deserved position and recognition in the scheme of affairs but will be a great blunder and de service if we fail to recognize our own. We are out to rewrite our story by ourselves and make the world know who we really are and not what they are made to believe about us in some concocted stories by maligned and envious people against this great city, ABA. So this group will be a veritable tool to achieving that by displaying our great talents and creativities, sharing our story to the rest of the world and projecting the name of the great city of ENYIMBA. Note: the group is not without rules as we will not tolerate any form of misconducts that will stand against the interest or even jeopardize the very essence of this group. * No sending of link. * No connecting of business involving money without the knowledge of the Admin of this group. * No attachment of phone numbers and shop address on your displayed work or services.

Do you know that generating Fun Filled packages determines Happiness. You understand?? . Now, here in Aba those packages are less or nowhere to be which invariably means that Happiness is far fetched.. On the process of finding Joy, we figured out some loosed screws in Aba Entertainment sector. Importantly, the focus, is to tighten up our activities by creating an online community here in through Facebook in order to get the goal achieved.. There are substances which is lacking in Aba fun concept which is perfectly working in Port Harcourt, Asaba, Owerri, Lagos, etc.. I would want us to help make ourselves happy here in Aba since the government has partly turned their backs against youth vibes. Amigo's 💕 One ❤Join"
